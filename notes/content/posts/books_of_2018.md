# Books of 2018

Ah books we all read them...I was usually reading more normal non technical books. I just love The Witcher saga from Andrzej Sapkowski and Metro saga from Dmitrij GÅ‚uchowski. Recently I find myself reading a lot more technical books, actually in 2018 I read only technical books due to a lot of context switching between different technologies. Books helped me to quickly accommodate in new technical stack I believe they are amazing source of knowledge. Here I want to recommend some of the books I read with brief description:

## [Core Data](https://www.objc.io/books/core-data/)

by: Florian Kugler and Daniel Eggert

I really like all the books from [obj.io](https://www.objc.io) group and honestly can recommend all of them if you are interested in iOS programming. 
This one is a great book I will certainly return to it. It is good if you are just beginning to play with `CoreData` or if you are already know the stuff I can assure that you will find something you never knew about Apple ORM framework.

## [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do)

This was my random pick I started my journey into Python world at the beginning of the 2018 and I it was the only book available in our company library ðŸ˜…. But no regrets I loved it! 
This one I can also recommend for beginners and people advanced in the subject. For me it was quite hard at the end but It provides a great overview of Python ecosystem and language tools that you can use to make your life easier.

## [App Architecture](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/)

by: Chris Eidhof, Matt Gallagher, and Florian Kugler

Ok, another [obj.io](https://www.objc.io) book, well yes, I told already that I really like them, with this one on my list I can say that I read all of them. You can find a lot of blog posts that try to tackle subject of iOS app architecture but none of them will describe it in such detail with all pros and cons. You will find here extended information about famos `MVC`, `MVVM+Coordinator`, `MVC+View State`, `ModelAdapter+ModelBinder` and `Elm`, there is even a whole chapter about Networking and whole book can be bought with great videos mage by authors ðŸ’¯

## [Introducing Elixir](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do)

by: Simon St. Laurent, J. Eisenberg

![Introducing Elixir](/images/introducing_elixir.jpg)

At some point company I work in (Applause) had a idea about writing chat based on [ejabber](https://www.ejabberd.im/) with additional extensions written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and I am a fun of this language I really liked the course I did on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/) about Elixir and Phoenix and on top of that it is a pure functional language so I really wanted to try to do something on production with a large scale with it. This book I can recommend to anyone who want to get to know Elixir ecosystem how to write code how modules are structured and how to work with all of it, overall amazing introduction that is a great base for anyone preparing to work in this technology. 

## [Introducing Erlang](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do)

by: Simon St. Laurent

![Introducing Erlang](/images/introducing_erlang.jpg)

Well we all know that nothing in software is simple especially if you want to use OSS project to do something it wasn't designed to do, and that is my story about [ejabber](https://www.ejabberd.im/). So here I present another O'Reilly book from introduction series. This one about [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) is another good introduction for anyone who wants to jump into functional programming world using Erlang. It will first introduce you to the history and idea of Erlang by explaining why it was designed like that. After that You can dive into the world of `gen_server`s.

## [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048992.do)

by: Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce

![Practical statistics](/images/practical_statistics.jpg)

Very good reminder about most important statistic techniques regarding Data Science. Here you will find a lot of data exploratory techniques, some practical examples of data mining using simple statistics that will let you understand how it works in more advanced Machine Learning frameworks. All examples here are in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) but there is a chapter with brief introduction to the language and IDE.
