# Vapor

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...I used [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io/) to try out `Swift` on server. Simultaneously other frameworks were developed like [Perfect](https://perfect.org/) and [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/). At That time it was mostly alpha/beta versions or work in progress, it wasn't as pleasurable as using `Swift` on machines with Apple sign.

Recently I decided to go back to that idea and `Vapor` is what I choose to test. So what is `Vapor` and from where did it came.
